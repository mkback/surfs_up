# Surfs Up 

## Overview 

##### W. Avy wants to open a surf shop in Hawaii, but wants to make sure the temperatures are good to make the ice cream business sustainable. In this projected we pulled temperature statistics from a SQL server to analyze the temperatures. 

## Results

* June has an average temperature of 74.9 while December has an average of 71. 
* June has a min of 64 while December is slightly lower at 56
* June has a max of 85 while December has a max of 83. 


## Summary 

#####Given these results we can see there are not huge significant changes in temperatures between the two months of the year. This is good news for W. Avy as the weather shouldnâ€™t affect sales too much throughout the year. To feel more confident with this decision we could run a query on how much rain fall or in which stations we see the best weather to decide if we have the best location on the island.
